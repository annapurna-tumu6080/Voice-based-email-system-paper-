# Abstract
Email communication has become an essential part of daily life; 
however, conventional email systems rely heavily on keyboard and visual interaction,
making them challenging for visually impaired users and inconvenient for hands-free usage.
This paper presents a Voice-Based Email System designed to enable users to compose, send, read, and manage emails using voice commands. 
The proposed system integrates speech-to-text technology for email composition and text-to-speech functionality for reading incoming messages aloud.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are employed to interpret user commands accurately and perform email operations efficiently. The system utilizes standard email protocols such as SMTP and IMAP to ensure secure and reliable communication. 
By eliminating the need for manual input, the proposed solution improves accessibility, enhances user experience, and promotes inclusive digital communication. The experimental results demonstrate that the system effectively performs email tasks with high accuracy and minimal user effort,
making it a practical solution for assistive and hands-free communication applications.
